<h2>Free Dog</h2>
<ul>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a free roaming dog who just wants to pee on fire hydrants; be careful to avoid dog catchers.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Laugh at the ridiculousness of the game concept.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Basic platforming/collecting
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
As a dog, the left and right arrow keys control running left and right.  The Spacebar is used to jump.  The up key is used to unleash a golden fury upon the fire hydrants of the world.  Ideally, the game would have had more challenge with additional spawning dog-catchers.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Gain some familiarity with javascript, phaser, and animation.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Color-changing fire hydrants
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a dog.  Dogs pee on things, especially fire hydrants.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People with nothing better to do with their time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Maybe a minute
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Jump over the dog catcher when he comes.
</li>
